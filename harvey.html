<center><h1>Harvey Specter</h1></center>
<p>Harvey Specter is an amazing and talented lawyer. For most of the show, we see him as a superhero who has never lost a case. He hires Mike Ross knowing he was a fraud. But, he is a name partner at Pearson Specter. He is my favorite person in Suits. He has a great and funny friendship with Mike and his secratry Donna. </p>
